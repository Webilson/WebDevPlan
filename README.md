# WebDevPlan
It's a plan to get a decent job as a web developer
Here it is:

basic computer proficiency is assumed.

Also linux because I’m doing it in linux and idk sometimes if you're on windows you have to do extra stuff with wsl and it sounds like a hassle. So just deal with the initial hassle of dual booting or using a VM on your current windows device and ye, then you’re good. Or get a chromebook or something idk.

# General stuff

1. Learn foundational programming stuff.
   1. Do [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) to get a high level overview of all sort of computer things
   2. Learn a programming language. Do [py4e](https://www.py4e.com/). Why not javascript you ask!??!?!?! Because you shouldn't get used to just one programming language. You'll learn javascript later.
2. Learn Basic Webdev Things. Just do [the odin project foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
3. Learn advanced computer stoff.
   1. Basics of a bunch of advanced essential computer science topics https://missing.csail.mit.edu/
   2. [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) ch 1-6
4. Learn adv webdev things.
   1. Do Colt Steele's complete webdev course. Not sponsored lmao. You maaay be wondering why we do this after we already did the odin project. The first like 30 sections of this course is html, css, and javascript, which we've already done. Welllllll firstly, [according to a few random internet people](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/m2fjfp/colt_steeles_the_web_developer_bootcamp_2021_is/) and ME, this course is pretty advanced and you should probably already know the basics before tackling it. Second, [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#literature-review). You're doing this after the advanced computer skills course, so it's been at least a few weeks.
   2. Do [the odin project's javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)
   3. DO SOME PRACTICE. Uh just do at least 3 from these lists or do your own projects if you already have your own ideas:
      - [Shop Talk show project ideas](https://github.com/melanierichards/just-build-websites)
      - UM PROBABLY PUT MORE

# less geneneral stoff

5. Um now figure out how to get a webdev job.
   1. Specialize. Learn an in-demand webdev skill. Um just google “in demand webdev skills”
   2. Mock interview lmao.
   3. Freelance experience??

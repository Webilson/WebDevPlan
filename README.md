# WebDevPlan
It's a plan to get a decent job as a web developer
Here it is:

basic computer proficiency is assumed.

Also linux because I’m doing it in linux and idk sometimes if you're on windows you have to do extra stuff with wsl and it sounds like a hassle. So just deal with the initial hassle of dual booting or using a VM on your current windows device and ye, then you’re good. Or get a chromebook or something idk.

# General stuff

1. Learn foundational programming stuff.
   1. Do [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) to get a high level overview of all sort of computer things
   2. Learn a programming language. Do [py4e](https://www.py4e.com/). Why not javascript you ask!??!?!?! Because you shouldn't get used to just one programming language. You'll learn javascript later.
2. Learn advanced computer stoff.
   1. Basics of a bunch of advanced essential computer science topics https://missing.csail.mit.edu/
   2. [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) ch 1-6
3. Learn basic webdev things.
   1. Do Colt Steele's complete webdev course. Not sponsored lmao 
   2. DO SOME PRACTICE:
      - Um put front-end, back-end, and projects here eg. A project that demonstrates you know how to use APIs
      - Upload stoff to your github.

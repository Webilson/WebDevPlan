# WebDevPlan
It's a plan to get a decent job as a web developer
Here it is:

basic computer proficiency is assumed.

Also linux because I’m doing it in linux and idk sometimes if you're on windows you have to do extra stuff with wsl and it sounds like a hassle. So just deal with the initial hassle of dual booting or using a VM on your current windows device and ye, then you’re good. Or get a chromebook or something idk.
